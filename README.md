Making the world's most famous TTRPG more accessible

### Elevator pitch

Dungeons and Dragons has been rising steadily in popularity for at least the last decade. It appeals to a variety of demographics for a variety of different reasons, but many are too overwhelmed by the seemingly complicated nature of the game to give it a try. My virtual tabletop will simplify the classic D&D character sheet as well as provide several additional tools to make the game more accessible both for beginning players and Game Masters. The minimal, retro-themed styling is designed to appeal to those who love the 8-bit graphics of 80s and 90s video games without being too overwhelming at first glance. It will highlight the essentials in order to actually start playing, while still providing more advanced mechanics for those who wish to use them.

**React** and **Javascript** will be the framework through which the different components are routed  

**Web service** will be used to retrieve user information as well as previous positioning on game mat
