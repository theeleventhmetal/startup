## Caddy

No problems worked just like it said in the [instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260/.github/blob/main/profile/webServers/https/https.md).

## HTML

Most complicated thing so far is keeping the code looking clean, convention is not enforced at all and it can get super confusing if you don't have your indentation correct


## CSS

AI is great for creating a skeleton of the layout you want to use but struggles with the specifics. It is useful to be familiar with the minutiae so that you can tweak things once you have a rough draft. Definitely split the CSS up into different files and then import all of them into one stylesheet for ease of reference and modularity. None of this matters anyways though because react is going to make a lot of this obsolete.
